  abstract = {By raising household income, remittances lower the marginal utility of targeted electoral transfers, thus weakening the efficacy of vote buying. Yet, remittances make individuals wealthier and believe the national economy is performing well, which is positively attributed to the incumbent. Building on these insights, I show that the confluence of these divergent channels generate a surprising result that at increasingly higher levels of dissatisfaction with the incumbent, a remittance recipient is more likely to vote for the incumbent than a non-remittance recipient. These predictions and their underlying mechanisms are substantiated across 18 Latin American countries.},

Moreover, while economic liberalization certainly spurred popular mobilization, it was the perceived failures of the particular modernization strategy undertaken by the PRI, not market reforms per se, that eroded single-party rule. Mexico's democratic transition is more usefully understood by focusing on how the PRI's particular brand of political and economic reform catalyzed its own bases of opposition. The increased willingness of voters to opt for untried political alternatives, and the rise of civil society, opposition parties and a more participatory mass politics were all endogenous to the domestic political system.},

It shows, rather, that in Latin America, this influence varies markedly among countries and over time, depending on cycles of currency booms and crises exogenous to policy making. Market discipline is strongest during periods of dollar scarcity, which, in low-savings commodity-exporting countries, occurs when commodity prices are high and international interest rates low. In periods of dollar abundance, when the opposite happens, the market's capacity to constrain leftist governments is very limited. Ultimately, Daniela Campello argues that financial integration should force the Left toward the center in economies less subject to these cycles, but not in those most vulnerable to them.},

In this article, we test informational, cognitive, and affective explanations for this behavior at the micro-level. Results form a nationally representative survey and a survey-experiment with a large convenience sample indicate that the misattribution of responsibility for the economy is more than just an informational problem; even when provided with information relative few respondents seem to use it correctly and even fewer do so when it requires confronting prior (positive or negative) affective judgements of political leaders.

Drawing on cross-national data from around the world and micro-level evidence from Latin America, Daniela Campello and Cesar Zucco make two broad, related arguments. First, they show that economic voting is pervasive around the world, but in economically volatile developing democracies that are dependent on commodity exports and inflows of foreign capital, economic outcomes are highly contingent on conditions beyond government control,  which nonetheless determine relevant political outcomes like elections, popular support, and government transitions. Second, politicians are aware of these misattribution patterns and are often able to anticipate their electoral prospects well before elections. This reduces incumbents' incentives to maximize voter welfare, as anticipated by economic voting theories, and increases the likelihood of shirking, waste, and corruption.},

I argue that remittances, due to their compensation and insurance functions, will increase the general income level and economic security of recipients, thereby reducing their perceived income risk. Over time, this will dampen demand from recipients for government taxation and social insurance. Therefore, I expect increases in income remitted to an economy to result in reduced levels of social welfare transfers at the macro-level. This dynamic can help us to understand spending patterns in developing democracies, and the absence of demand for social security transfers in countries with high levels of inequality and economic insecurity. I test this argument with a sample of 18 Latin American states, over the period 1990 to 2009, and subject the central causal mechanism to a battery of statistical tests. The results of these tests provide strong support for this argument.},

In Mexico, however, crime has become the second (if not the first) concern of voters and security evaluations have become closely linked to the national executive's performance. In this paper we posit that in Mexico remittances can also increase incumbent support through their effect on recipients' security assessments. We attribute this finding to remittances allowing recipients to take crime-preventive measures and alleviate some of the pressure associated with crime and violence, which in turn improves recipients' assessments of the security situation of the country and evaluations of the incumbent. Using individual data from Mexico for the period 2006{\textendash}2017, we find that remittance recipients have higher levels of perceived personal safety and better national security evaluations than non-recipients, and that security assessments are a significant predictor of presidential approval rates. The evidence thus suggests that in Mexico, where crime is rising, and presidents are increasingly rewarded or blamed for containing violence, the effect of remittances on presidential approval also operates through improved personal safety perceptions and public security assessments.},

Relying on a unique four-wave panel study of Kyrgyz citizens between 2010{\textendash}2013 and a cross-sectional sample of 28 countries in Central Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia, we show that when people experience a decrease (increase) in remittances, they become less (more) satisfied about their household economic situation and misattribute responsibility to the incumbent at home. Our findings advance the literature on the political consequences of remittance payments and suggest that far from exclusively being an international risk-sharing mechanism for developing countries, remittances can also drive fluctuations in incumbent approval and compromise rudimentary accountability mechanisms in the developing world.},

As we pointed out in the Introduction, the theoretical and empirical focus of this book is on explaining contextual variation in the economic vote, as defined in the previous chapter. Before proceeding to these efforts, we address two particularly critical empirical tasks in this chapter. First, is there a significant and pervasive economic vote in advanced democracies? Second, is there significant contextual variation in the economic vote that is sufficiently interesting to justify a book-length treatment?The first question we posed is not simply rhetorical. There is considerable skepticism as to the importance of economic voting (a recent statement is Cheibub and Przeworski, 1999). If, as some would argue, economic voting were apparent in only a small number of countries or elections, or if it were wildly inconsistent in direction and magnitude, then there would be little reason to try to understand how contextual factors might affect it. Part of this skepticism concerns the importance of economic evaluations relative to other influences on the vote. Again, if economic evaluations have a much weaker influence on the vote than other factors, then our time would be better spent studying contextual variation in those factors. Readers can probably anticipate the answers to these questions.},

As a result, remittance recipients have relatively fewer economic grievances and tend to feel more optimistic about economic matters than neighbors who do not receive remittances. According to the economic voter thesis, citizens who are more satisfied with the economy are also less likely to pressure and oppose politicians, particularly incumbents. Analyses indicate that respondents in this sample who receive remittances are indeed less likely to lobby local officials for economic assistance. They were also less likely to mobilize against and punish the incumbent party in the 2006 Mexican presidential election.},

  abstract = {When the economy in a single country contracts, voters often punish the government. When many economies contract, voters turn against their governments much less frequently. This suggests that the international context matters for the domestic vote, yet most research on electoral accountability assumes that voters treat their national economies as autarkic. We decompose two key economic aggregates{\textemdash}growth in real gross domestic product and unemployment{\textemdash}into their international and domestic components and demonstrate that voters hold incumbents more electorally accountable for the domestic than for the international component of growth. Voters in a wide variety of democracies benchmark national economic growth against that abroad, punishing (rewarding) incumbents for national outcomes that underperform (outperform) an international comparison. Tests suggest that this effect arises not from highly informed voters making direct comparisons but from ``pre-benchmarking'' by the media when reporting on the economy. The effect of benchmarked growth exceeds that of aggregate national growth by up to a factor of two and outstrips the international component of growth by an even larger margin, implying that previous research may have underestimated the strength of the economy on the vote.},

  abstract = {This paper develops several simple multivariate statistical models and applies them to explain fluctuations in the aggregate vote for the United States House of Representatives, over the period 1896-1964. The basic hypothesis underlying these models is that voters are rational in at least the limited sense that their decisions as to whether to vote for an incumbent administration depend on whether its performance has been ``satisfactory'' according to some simple standard. Because of data limitations, the analysis focuses on measures of economic performance, treating other aspects of an incumbent's performance, such as its handling of foreign affairs, as stochastic perturbations of the underlying relationship to be estimated. (Examination of residuals suggests this assumption is not unreasonable, at least during peacetime.) Possible effects of coattails from presidential races, of incumbency, and of secular trends in the underlying partisanship of the electorate are also taken into account. The models, estimated by maximum-likelihood methods, are found to be successful. Close to two-thirds of the variance in the vote series is accounted for, and the structural coefficients of the models are of the correct signs and of quite reasonable magnitudes. Economic growth, as measured by the changes in real per capita income, is the major economic variable; unemployment or inflation have little independent effect. Presidential coattails are also found to be of some importance.},

  abstract = {We examine the political economy mechanisms that link resource abundance and economic development by analyzing the recent increase in Brazil's oil production and the distribution of oil royalties to municipalities. We explore a fixed geographic rule which determines who receive oil royalties and investigate how incumbents spend oil windfall and the impact of these rents on local elections. We show that oil windfall creates a large incumbency advantage in the election that follows oil windfall boom, but this effect disappears in the medium-run. Royalty payments are associated with a large increase in the number of municipal employees, but we don't find any significant impact on household infrastructure, education and health supply. The pattern of the increase in public jobs indicates that voters reward increases in public sector and audit data suggest that institutions limit this increase. Taken together, our results indicate that oil does not make leaders unaccountable, and provide suggestive evidence that constraints on the executive branch restrained the the irresponsible use of oil revenues. These results point out that a democratic system is crucial to avoid the negative effects of resource abundance but also indicate that the institutions in place are not sufficient to transform natural resource wealth into economic development.},

Citizen support provides important leverage for executives, allowing them to continue their policies. Yet winning citizens' hearts and minds is not easy. Public security is a deeply complex issue. Responsibility is shared among different levels of government; information is highly mediated by mass media and individual acquaintances; and security has a strong effect on peoples' emotions, since it threatens to affect their most valuable assets{\textemdash}life and property. How do citizens translate their assessments of public security into presidential approval? To answer this question, this study develops explicit theoretical insights into the conditions under which different dimensions of public security affect presidential approval. The arguments are tested using Mexico as a case study.},

  abstract = {While increased exposure to the global economy is associated with  increased welfare effort in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD), the opposite holds in the developing world. These  differences are typically explained with reference to domestic politics.  Tradables, unions, and the like in the developing world are assumed to  have less power or interests divergent to those in the  OECD{\textemdash}interests that militate against social spending. I claim that  such arguments can be complemented with a recognition that developed and  developing nations have distinct patterns of integration into global  markets. While income shocks associated with international markets are  quite modest in the OECD, they are profound in developing nations. In the  OECD, governments can respond to those shocks by borrowing on capital  markets and spending countercyclically on social programs. No such  opportunity exists for most governments in the developing world, most of  which have limited access to capital markets in tough times, more  significant incentives to balance budgets, and as a result cut social  spending at the times it is most needed. Thus, while internationally  inspired volatility and income shocks seem not to threaten the  underpinnings of the welfare state in rich nations, it undercuts the  capacity of governments in the developing world to smooth consumption (and  particularly consumption by the poor) across the business cycle.The author would like to thank Steph Haggard,  Kristin Bakke, Wongi Choe, Tim Jones, and seminar participants at Duke  University, Penn State University, Washington University, MIT, and the  University of New Mexico for their helpful comments.

In a study of how remittances from overseas respond to income shocks experienced by Philippine households, changes in income are found to lead to changes in remittances in the opposite direction, consistent with an insurance motivation. Roughly 60 percent of declines in household income are replaced by remittance inflows from overseas. Because household income and remittances are jointly determined, rainfall shocks are used as instrumental variables for income changes. The hypothesis cannot be rejected that consumption in households with migrant members is unchanged in response to income shocks, whereas consumption responds strongly to income shocks in households without migrants.},
